This is a library of Kerbal Operating System script that execute various functions. One launches to a circularized orbit, one launches to the Mun, and one plans a "moon tour" (a quick journey between all the moon of some body).

Attribution is in the code where code was adapted from some other source.

Feel free to check out some videos of the scripts in action (sorry for the boring narrating):\
